## Welcome to my humens site!!!

This site is your go-to location for the research assignment I have to do.
# _Homo sapiens_ introduction
_Homo sapiens_ are a _sapient_ species. Sapient means wise. They are the only species of the _homo_ genus to still be alive. The other ones were too dumb, so either they became _homo sapiens_ too, or they died. I won't cover the species that died, because they don't matter. Instead, I will come to matters of importance.
# Genotypes and phenotypes
_Genotypes_ are genetic differences between organisms that have a different result, while _phenotypes_ are the **\*visual\*** result of genotypes.
If you are a human (tip: if you're not sure if you are one, chances are that if you're reading this, you're a human! Yay!), then you have seen the visual variation between different people. This is all because of phenotypes. I will give some examples below.
