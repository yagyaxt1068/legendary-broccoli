## Welcome to my humens site!!!

This site is your go-to location for the research assignment I have to do.
# _Homo sapiens_ introduction
_Homo sapiens_ are a _sapient_ species. Sapient means wise. They are the only species of the _homo_ genus to still be alive. The other ones were too dumb, so either they became _homo sapiens_ too, or they died. I won't cover the species that died, because they don't matter. Instead, I will come to matters of importance.
# Genotypes and phenotypes
_Genotypes_ are genetic differences between organisms that have a different result, while _phenotypes_ are the **\*visual\*** result of genotypes.
If you are a human (tip: if you're not sure if you are one, chances are that if you're reading this, you're a human! Yay!), then you have seen the visual variation between different people. This is all because of phenotypes. I will give some examples below.
## North Asia-North American
In this section, I will be discussing the _Pacifid_, _Silvid_ _Eskimid_, _Turanid_ and other such phenotypes.
These phenotypes are found in similar climates, and as such have certain similarities.
For one, they have squinty eyes. This helps small particles from coming in the eyes (helpful both in snowstorms and the Gobi Desert). They also tend to be short with smaller bodies, as these most likely live in environments where food can be scarce, so smaller bodies are more energy-efficient and reduce overhead. They are usually found in the Arctic regions or mountains.
## Central and South America
The _Silvid_(southern), _Centralid_, _Amazonid_ and other such phenotypes are similar in some aspects to their northern counterparts, but in other aspects resemble the _Europid_ and _Indid_ phenotypes. They tend to be taller as in the temperate and equatorial regions, food is more common
## Europe, Middle East and South Asia
I have grouped these phenotypes into one group as they have certain similarities. They all have more visible eyes, and with the exception of some Indids, have taller heights (mostly in the temperate zones.) They tend to be thinner, as in hot environments, too much fat only makes one more warm. (I state that from experience.) Their hair ranges from black to blonde, and skin color ranges from dark (_Veddid_ in South India) to pale (_Nordid_ in Scandinavia). Pale skin will be seen in colder environments (lighter skin is more reflective and easier to see at dark), while darker skin will be seen in warmer environments (as dark skin doesn't easily get sunburnt, and is easier to see in lighter environments).
## Africa
Africa has many phenotypes, each with its own unique features, specifically suited to the region they reside in. This is because humans in Africa have had a longer time to evolve than rest of the humans who spread into Eurasia and the Americas. They all have dark skin (owing to the fact they reside in a hot environment), usually short, curly hair (long, curly hair generates more heat), and tall bodies (lots of game in Africa).

# Human history
Okay, time for a (very) brief history of humans! (Human history is so darn big.)
First, humans were just your ordinary primates. Homonids (members of the _homo_ genus) began to split off from other primates around 4 million years ago. Early homonids lived in trees, but as the savannah grew larger, they then began to adapt to ground life. After millions of years, competition for resources grew, and with the development of language around 50,000 years ago, humans were able to communicate plans and spread out of the African continent into other landmasses. An emigration map is embedded below (from Khan Academy).

Eventually, humans developed the foundations for modern society. The invention of agriculture freed up time that was initially spent on hunting and gathering, so they came up with new ways to pass their time, including creating art and music, pondering the universe, creating societal roles for every human, building machines and computers to aid in their pursuits, and even studying their own origins (source: me).
# Future
```
The future of humans is a very difficult domain. The changes they made to the 
environment threaten their very own existence. However, there is a hope. Computers.

You can stop laughing now.
It's true. If we work towards it, our consciousnesses can be integrated into computers.
This will help extend our lifespans and get rid of current needs.
However, this raises a question of ethics.
Will we maintain some human urges? Will we abandon them all?

Only time will tell.
