# Canadian immigration history and ethnic group focus

On this site, I explain some key events in the history of Canadian immigration.

# Part 1: The timeline

## Chinese Immigration Act, 1885

The Chinese Immigration Act was created to discourage Chinese people from immigrating from Canada. This happened because Canada needed labor for the CPR, and China provided. Initially the head tax was $50/head. This later changed to $100, then $500.

## Komagata Maru incident (1914)

The Komagata Maru was a ship sailing from India headed towards Vancouver. When the ship landed, people were not allowed to leave. Since the ship had made stops for refueling and supplies in Japan, they couldn't land as that was against the law stating that Indians had to immigrate on nonstop ships. In the end, only some people were let off the ship, and the rest were sent back.

## War Measures Act (WW1, 1914-1920)

When World War 1 broke out, the War Measures act was enacted. The War Measures Act allowed for mass incarceration of anyone who was perceived to be an enemy. In the case of WW1, this enemy was Eastern Europe, especially Ukraine. They were largely hated and not seen as white enough. Some people regarded them even lower than First Nations. When the War Measures Act was enacted, Ukranians were sent into concentration camps and used as slave labor, until the end of the Act in 1920.

## Chinese Immigration Act, 1923 (also known as the Chinese Exclusion Act)

The new Chinese Immigration Act banned Chinese immigration for most cases. However, the head tax was removed  for Chinese people. (Newfoundland was an exception, as they were a separate colony at the time. They still allowed Chinese immigration, for the sum of $200.) Progress?

## War Measures Act (WW2, 1940-1945)

The War Measures Act was brought back for World War 2, this time not with one, but two ethnic groups interned!

### Italian internment (1940-1943)

![alt text](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F4%2F47%2FBenito_Mussolini_crop.jpg%2F200px-Benito_Mussolini_crop.jpg&f=1&nofb=1 "Mussolini, the man who (purportedly) made the trains run on time.")

When Mussolini declared war against the UK, Canada detained all Italian Canadians and did the same things to them that they did to the Ukranians. Once Mussolini was removed from his position, Canada ended the Italian internment program, and the Italians were free.

### Japanese internment (1942-1945)

In 1942, Japan did a preemptive strike on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Once that was taken care of, Canada and Murica started two independent Japanese internment programs, in yet another bout of Canadian mass incarceration. Starting with the Greater Vancouver region, Japanese prisoners were taken in, detained, and since Canada already had a hatred for Asians, had their rights taken away. They were made to work on railroads, and it wasn't until 1948 that Japanese people finally gained the right to vote, just in time for Newfoundland to join Canada (with its Chinese settlers).

## Canadian Citizenship Act, 1947

In 1947, the concept of Canadian citizenship was finally defined. Before that, anyone who immigrated to Canada could vote, if they met a certain criteria. This also created different categories for immigration.

## Newfoundland head tax removal, 1949

Once Newfoundland (finally) joined Confederation, the last Chinese people paying the head tax in the British North America region were freed from the tax. This change, along with the Canadian Citizenship Act, helped make Canada more accepting of foreigners.

## Immigration Act, 1976 (1978)

![alt text](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pier21.ca%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fgallery%2F12517%2Fi-30456-005.jpg&f=1&nofb=1 "This page of the act defines refugees and their rights.")

Despite the name, the Immigration Act, 1976 was put into effect two years later, in 1978. The act recognized refugees as an immigrant class, opening up Canada to people who needed shelter  or asylum from other countries. (They still didn't accept Snowden's application for asylum, though, so I'm not impressed.)

## Singh Decision (1986)

Once refugees were opened up as an immigrant class, however, the application process was very hard to do, and 7 people of Indian origin were denied their applications, stating that they did not meet the requirements. However, they did not specify the reasons or provide the opportunity to appeal. The case made it to the Supreme Court as _Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration_. The appellants argued that refusing their applications was a breach of Section 7 (the rights to life, liberty and security). In the end, they won the case. This allowed for refugees to be protected throughout their application process.

## Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, 2002

![alt text]( "")

The [IRPA](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/FullText.html) was enacted in 2002 and updated the legislation regarding immigration, with a special focus on refugees. As part of it, a simplified refugee appeal process was proposed to help alleviate the load on the courts caused by the Singh decision. However, it hasn't been fully implemented.

# Part 2: History of East Indian immigration in Canada (group focus)

To start off, I am going to make one clarification of the title. Europeans had a habit of going to an unknown place and slapping the title 'India' on it, so to avoid confusion with First Nations, Native Americans, and other natives of the North and South American continents, I will refer to these people (of which I am a part of) as Indians and the natives as their respective proper names.

## History of immigration in Canada

### Pre-1947

Indians were often employed as British soldiers both before and after the 1857 revolt, and as such, found their way to other British territories. The closest Canadian territory was British Columbia, so naturally a lot of Indians arrived there, as Port Moody and Port Vancouver were their main ports of entry. Most were Punjabis, for reasons I have yet to discover. This resulted in a large Punjabi community in the area, concentrated in the areas of Delta and Surrey. They made their own businesses (something I can say myself, since I have Punjabi heritage.). However, they faced some obstacles. One of them, in a way similar to the Chinese head tax, was that they had to have 200 Canadian dollars with them when they arrived, which made it hard for some to arrive because it was hard to get that much currency converted. Another issue in arrivals is that their journeys had to be nonstop for them to arrive. In an era before airplanes, this was understandably quite hard to do. The Canadian government knew what they were doing, which was to keep non-European settlers out as much as possible.

### Post-1947

When India gained independence from the British Empire and the Republic of India was formed, India was more forceful in their negotiations. For example, for a time, they did not allow any foreign publications or periodicals (magazines, newspapers, journals) in the country. Another side effect of the independence was the Indian government recognizing the troubles of people immigrating into Canada. This, combined with an increase in North American counterculture, prompted the easing of restrictions. Since air travel was mainstream, many people arrived by air, and that resulted in huge Indian immigration into Toronto in the 60s and 70s, creating the Little India region of the city. Eventually, Indians migrated to other places in Canada, one of those places being Edmonton.

## How they made their mark

Refugee Rights Day, celebrated every year on April 4 (yesterday as of the time of writing), is the anniversary of the Singh decision, a case that was started by, you guessed it, Indians.

### In Canada

Punjabi is the most commonly spoken language in Canada after English and French, and there are two major concentrations of Indians in Canada: the Lower Mainland area in BC (where I used to live) and the Greater Toronto Area. Both of these areas have a large number of Indians, especially Punjabis.

### In Alberta

Alberta is the area with the third largest number of Indians in Canada. Calgary and Jaipur became sister cities in 1973, further strengthening the relation of the regions. Calgary has a large Indian community and Calgary's mayor, Naheed Nenshi, is Gujarati himself.

### In Edmonton

Southeast Edmonton has a large concentration of Indian people. The Mill Woods area is home to many Punjabis, and surrounding areas like The Meadows and Ellerslie have a large population of them as well. In fact, a significant portion of students in our own class have Indian heritage or some connection to India. There are a few Indian communities in Edmonton, with some of them for Sikhs:

## Indian communities in Edmonton

### Council of India Societies of Edmonton (CISE)

The CISE was created in 1976 to represent Indians in Edmonton, as the Indian community was beginning to grow. It functions as a community centre, as well as a place for members of various Indian societies in the city to meet.

#### Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sahib

Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha was founded in 1977, originating from a group of Sikh teachers and students at the University of Alberta who congregated regularly at the Jubilee Auditorium. They have had a few other locations in the past before settling in their current location in Pollard Meadows.
