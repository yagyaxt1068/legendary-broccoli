## Welcome to my humens site!!!

This site is your go-to location for the research assignment I have to do.
# _Homo sapiens_ introduction
_Homo sapiens_ are a _sapient_ species. Sapient means wise. They are the only species of the _homo_ genus to still be alive. The other ones were too dumb, so either they became _homo sapiens_ too, or they died. I won't cover the species that died, because they don't matter. Instead, I will come to matters of importance.
# Genotypes and phenotypes
_Genotypes_ are genetic differences between organisms that have a different result, while _phenotypes_ are the **\*visual\*** result of genotypes.
If you are a human (tip: if you're not sure if you are one, chances are that if you're reading this, you're a human! Yay!), then you have seen the visual variation between different people. This is all because of phenotypes. I will give some examples below.
## North Asia-Native American
In this section, I will be discussing the _Pacifid_, _Silvid_ _Eskimid_, _Turanid_ and other such phenotypes.
These phenotypes are found in similar climates, and as such have certain similarities.
For one, they have squinty eyes. This helps vision stay consistent during snowstorms. (If you're _Europid_, _Mediterranid_, _Afrid_, _Orientalid_, _Indid_ or any other one of those other ones, you know how it is.) They also tend to be short, which also helps when going through snow. (Smaller, lighter animals get around in snowstorms easier.) They are usually found in the Arctic regions or mountains.
## Europe, Middle East and South Asia
I have grouped these phenotypes into one group as they have certain similarities. They all have more visible eyes, and with the exception of some Indids, have taller heights (mostly in the temperate zones.) They tend to be thinner, as in hot environments, too much fat only makes one more warm.
