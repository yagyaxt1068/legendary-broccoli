# Canadian immigration history and ethnic group focus

On this site, I explain some key events in the history of Canadian immigration.

# Part 1: The timeline

## Chinese Immigration Act, 1885

The Chinese Immigration Act was created to discourage Chinese people from immigrating from Canada. This happened because Canada needed labor for the CPR, and China provided. Initially the head tax was $50/head. This later changed to $100, then $500.

## Komagata Maru incident (1914)

The Komagata Maru was a ship sailing from India headed towards Vancouver. When the ship landed, people were not allowed to leave. Since the ship had made stops for refueling and supplies in Japan, they couldn't land as that was against the law stating that Indians had to immigrate on nonstop ships. In the end, only some people were let off the ship, and the rest were sent back.

## War Measures Act (WW1, 1914-1920)

When World War 1 broke out, the War Measures act was enacted. The War Measures Act allowed for mass incarceration of anyone who was perceived to be an enemy. In the case of WW1, this enemy was Eastern Europe, especially Ukraine. They were largely hated and not seen as white enough. Some people regarded them even lower than First Nations. When the War Measures Act was enacted, Ukranians were sent into concentration camps and used as slave labor, until the end of the Act in 1920.

## Chinese Immigration Act, 1923 (also known as the Chinese Exclusion Act)

The new Chinese Immigration Act banned Chinese immigration for most cases. However, the head tax was removed (except for Newfoundland, as they were a separate colony. They still allowed Chinese immigration, for the sum of $200.) for Chinese people. Progress.

## War Measures Act (WW2, 1940-1945)

The War Measures Act was brought back for World War 2, this time not with one, but two ethnic groups interned!

### Italian internment (1940-1943)

When Mussolini (the man who made the trains run on time) declared war against the UK, Canada detained all Italian Canadians and did the same things to them that they did to the Ukranians. Once Mussolini was removed from his position, Canada ended the Italian internment program, and the Italians were free.

### Japanese internment (1942-1945)

In 1942, Japan did a preemptive strike on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Once that was taken care of, Canada and Murica started two independent Japanese internment programs, in yet another bout of Canadian mass incarceration. Starting with the Greater Vancouver region, Japanese prisoners were taken in, detained, and since Canada already had a hatred for Asians, had their rights taken away. They were made to work on railroads, and it wasn't until 1948 that Japanese people finally gained the right to vote, just in time for Newfoundland to join Canada (with its Chinese settlers).

## Canadian Citizenship Act, 1947

In 1947, the concept of Canadian citizenship was finally defined. Before that, anyone who immigrated to Canada could vote, if they met a certain criteria. This also created different categories for immigration.

## Newfoundland head tax removal, 1949

Once Newfoundland (finally) joined Confederation, the last Chinese people paying the head tax in the British North America region were freed from the tax. This change, along with the Canadian Citizenship Act, helped make Canada more accepting of foreigners.

## Immigration Act, 1976 (1978)

Despite the name, the Immigration Act, 1976 was put into effect two years later, in 1978. The act recognized refugees as an immigrant class, opening up Canada to people who needed shelter  or asylum from other countries. (They still didn't accept Snowden's application for asylum, though, so I'm not impressed.)

## Singh Decision (1986)

Once refugees were opened up as an immigrant class, however, the application process was very hard to do, and 7 people of Indian origin were denied their applications, stating that they did not meet the requirements. However, they did not specify the reasons or provide the opportunity to appeal. The case made it to the Supreme Court as _Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration_. The appellants argued that refusing their applications was a breach of Section 7 (the rights to life, liberty and security). In the end, they won the case. This allowed for refugees to be protected throughout their application process.

## Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, 2002
 
The IRPA was enacted in 2002 and updated the legislation regarding immigration, with a special focus on refugees. As part of it, a simplified refugee appeal process was proposed to help alleviate the load on the courts caused by the Singh decision. However, it hasn't been fully implemented.
